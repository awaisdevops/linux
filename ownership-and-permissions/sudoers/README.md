# Guide to `sudoers` File and Advanced Permissions

The `sudoers` file is an important configuration file in Linux systems. It allows system administrators to control which users have permission to execute commands with root privileges. This guide explains how to use the `sudoers` file to grant specific users permission to run root-privileged commands.

## What is the `sudoers` File?

The `sudoers` file is used to configure advanced permissions for normal Linux users to execute root-privileged commands. Unlike SUID, which grants all users access to certain root-privileged commands, the `sudoers` file allows administrators to specify which commands individual users can run as root.

### Why Use `sudoers` Over SUID?

- **SUID** grants root-privileged command access to all users.
- **`sudoers`** grants root-privileged command access only to specified users or groups, enhancing security.

## Editing the `sudoers` File

Itâ€™s **extremely important** to edit the `sudoers` file carefully. Use the `visudo` command to safely edit this file. This tool ensures syntax errors are checked before saving, which prevents misconfigurations.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

**Important**: Always use `visudo` to edit the `sudoers` file to avoid syntax errors that could lock you out of administrative access.

## Example Usage of `sudoers`

### Allow a User to Execute a Root-Privileged Command

To allow a user (e.g., `wwe`) to execute the `fdisk` command as root, add the following line to the end of the `sudoers` file:

```bash
wwe ALL=/usr/sbin/fdisk
```

Now, the user `wwe` can run the `fdisk` command as root:

```bash
su - wwe
sudo fdisk -l
```

This command will now work for the user `wwe` since they have been granted permission to execute `fdisk` as a root-privileged command.

## Adding a User to the `sudo` Group

If you want to give a user the ability to execute **all** root commands, add the user to the `sudo` group. You can do this in two ways:

### 1. Using `usermod`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo wwe
```

This command adds the user `wwe` to the `sudo` group, granting them permission to execute all commands as root.

### 2. Editing the `sudoers` File:

Alternatively, you can directly edit the `/etc/sudoers` file to include the user in the `sudo` group:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add the following entry to the file:

```bash
wwe   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

This grants the user `wwe` permission to run any command as root.

## Granting Specific Root-Privileged Command Permissions

You may want to give a normal user permission to execute specific root-privileged commands. For example, to allow the user `rondarosy` to manage the Apache server, add the following to the `sudoers` file:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Then, add the following line:

```bash
rondarosy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl start apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl restart apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl status apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl enable apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl stop apache2
```

**Explanation**:
- `rondarosy`: The username.
- `NOPASSWD`: The user won't be asked for a password when running these commands.
- The commands listed allow the user to manage the Apache service.

Now, the user `rondarosy` can execute any of the Apache management commands with `sudo` without entering a password.

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

## Using Command Aliases in `sudoers`

If you want to assign multiple commands to a user or group, you can use **Command Aliases**. This allows you to group commands together and apply them to one or more users.

### Example: Define a Command Alias

Add the following entry to the `sudoers` file:

```bash
Cmnd_Alias APACHE_CMDS = /usr/bin/systemctl start apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl restart apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl status apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl stop apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl enable apache2
```

### Assign the Alias to a User

Now, assign the alias to a user (e.g., `rondarosy`):

```bash
rondarosy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: APACHE_CMDS
```

This grants `rondarosy` permission to run all Apache-related systemctl commands without a password, using the alias.
